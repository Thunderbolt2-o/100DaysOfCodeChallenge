# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
#Write your code below this line 👇
c = 9090 # LOL this line is not requried 
c = a
a = b
b = c
#Write your code above this line 👆
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

# One of the most important things in coding is, 🚨 code should be always readable 🚨

# Wow😁 first project in python (Beginner😅)
# solution 👇👇
# 1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
